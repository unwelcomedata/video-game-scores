## Data Sources

All data sources are documented in [SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md) with full
attribution, URLs, licenses, and retrieval notes.

Source provenance is also recorded inside the project database:

```sql
-- Open data/project.duckdb and run:
SELECT * FROM _sources;
```

## Workflow

### 1. Configure `config.yaml`

Add each data source under the `sources:` block before ingesting:

```yaml
sources:
  my_source:
    url: https://example.gov/data/table
    type: html_table      # html_table | html_scrape | csv | json
    table_index: 0
    js_render: false
```

### 2. Document sources in `SOURCES.md`

Before ingesting any data, add an entry to `SOURCES.md` for each source:
- Full URL
- Publisher / agency
- License
- Fields used
- Any caveats

### 3. Ingest (`01-ingest.ipynb`)

```python
from src.ingest import load_config, ingest_source
cfg = load_config("config.yaml")
df = ingest_source("my_source", cfg)
```

Raw files land in `data/raw/` untouched. All tables load into DuckDB at
`data/project.duckdb` with source metadata written to `_sources`.

### 4. Clean (`02-clean.ipynb`)

```python
from src.clean_quality import get_connection, clean_table, quality_report, save_interim
con = get_connection(cfg)
df_clean = clean_table(df, "my_source_raw", con, cast_map={"year": "INTEGER"})
quality_report(df_clean, "my_source_clean", con)
save_interim(df_clean, cfg, "my_source_clean.parquet")
```

### 5. Prepare & export (`03-prepare.ipynb`)

```python
from src.prepare import package_dataset
package_dataset(df, cfg, name="my_dataset_v1",
                codebook={"col": "description"},
                notes="Source: Agency. License: Public domain.")
```

### 6. Visualize (`04-viz.ipynb` + `04b-viz-social.ipynb`)

**04-viz** is for exploratory charting (matplotlib). Output goes to `outputs/`.

```python
from src.viz import ranked_bar_chart, save_chart
fig = ranked_bar_chart(df, x="state", y="rate", title="Top 10 States", top_n=10,
                       preset="instagram_portrait")
save_chart(fig, cfg, "top10_states", preset="instagram_portrait",
           add_watermark="@unwelcomedata")
```

**04b-viz-social** is for publication-ready charts (Altair + vl-convert).
Output goes to `outputs/social/`. Only curated, validated charts go here.

```python
from src.viz_social import save_social
save_social(chart, cfg, 'my_social_chart', preset='twitter_landscape')
```

### 7. Analyze (`05-analysis.ipynb`)

Statistical analysis, regression, group comparisons. Always read from the
**export** parquet (not raw DuckDB tables) to ensure consistency with
published data.

## Publishing (when the project is ready to go public)

Full procedure is in `.kiro/steering/public-release.md`. The essentials:

1. **Validate first (required gate).** Ship a `scripts/validate_charts.py` that
   re-checks the chart data against DuckDB (export drift, headline facts,
   invariants) and run it — it must exit 0 before anything goes public. See
   `scripts/README.md`.
2. **Curate a `release` branch** for the public tree (fun tier drops
   notebooks/src/scripts/config; serious tier keeps src + a reproducible
   entrypoint). Force-add the CSV + codebook exports and the `docs/` charts.
3. **`_config.yml`** (root, on both `main` and `release`): set `title:` to the
   **project name** so the Cayman banner names the project — NOT the generic
   `@unwelcomedata` (that leaves the page looking untitled). Put the brand in
   `description:`. Theme is always `jekyll-theme-cayman` (shared identity).
4. **README brand line** links `@unwelcomedata` to the **GitHub profile**
   (`https://github.com/unwelcomedata`), never a self-link to the project's own
   Pages URL.
5. After publishing, **`git checkout main`** — leaving the repo on `release`
   strips the notebooks from the working copy and looks like they vanished
   (they're safe on `main`).

## Anonymity

Commits are authored as `unwelcomedata` to keep the author's real identity
off the public commit history. Data files, exports, outputs, and `.env`
secrets are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.
